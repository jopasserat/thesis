\section{General context and motivations}

%I have been studying Computer Science for more than 8 years now.
%I remember my first lectures on quality assurance (QA) and
%software testing, how pointless it seemed to all of us, students
%who do not write bugs \footnote{The last part of this sentence is
%adapted from this tweet:
%\url{https://twitter.com/hipsterhacker/status/396352411754717184}.}.
Almost a decade ago, \emph{quality assurance} (QA) was not a
common practice, and researchers had to prove, for instance, what
the benefits of testing could be. Generally speaking, quality
assurance is a way of preventing faults in manufactured products,
which is defined in ISO 9000 as "part of quality management
focused on providing confidence that quality requirements will be
fulfilled" \cite{iso20059000}. \emph{Software testing} provides
information about the quality of software. For instance, testing
can prove confidence of a software system by executing a program
with the intent of finding errors, also known as "bugs"
\cite{Myers:1979:AST:539883}.

Nowadays, quality assurance and software testing are well-known
in the Industry, and everyone understands the need for them.
Yet, testing is often performed by hand, which is complicated
and far from perfect. Software testing can be seen as a sequence
of three major steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The design of test cases that are good at revealing
        faults, according to a certain level of requirement;

    \item The execution of these test cases;

    \item The determination of whether the produced output is
        correct.
\end{enumerate}

Sadly, the test case execution is often the only fully automated
aspect of this activity in the Industry. \emph{Continuous
Integration} (CI) \cite{booch1991object} is now associated with
the automation of the execution of test cases and quick feedback,
often received by email. There are countless tools and services
\footnote{For example, Travis CI: \url{https://travis-ci.org/}.}
to automate this process, but too few tools have emerged to
tackle the problem of test case generation for instance.
Fortunately, in Academia, researchers have studied such a problem
for decades \cite{4221614}.

A relatively recent field to automate and improve testing is
\emph{Model-based Testing} (MbT). While the original idea has
been around for decades \cite{moore56}, there has been a growing
interest over the last few years.  MbT is application of (formal)
Model-based design for designing and optionally also executing
artifacts to perform software testing
\cite{Jorgensen:1995:STC:526521}. The use of a model allows to
formally describe the expected behaviors of a software, from
which it is possible to automatically generate the test cases,
and then to execute them.  Nonetheless, writing such models is
tedious and error-prone, which is a drawback and can also explain
the slow adoption of MbT in the Industry.

\emph{Model inference} is a research field that aims at
automatically deriving models, expressing functional behaviors of
existing software. These models, even if incomplete, help
understand how a software behaves. That is why model inference is
interesting to solve the limitation of MbT mentioned previously.
Most of the model inference techniques that are used for testing
purpose are not designed to infer large models or to test large
software systems though. Anti-Model-based Testing \cite{antimbt} is
somehow related to this idea, although Anti-Model-based Testing
is more about using testing to reverse-engineer a model, and then
check such a model to detect whether the software behaves
correctly. In this thesis, reverse-engineering of a model is
achieved by monitoring the system without disturbing it or even
stimulating it, \emph{i.e.} we do not rely on testing during model
inference.

Michelin, one of the three largest tire manufacturers in the
world, has been our industrial partner for the last three years.
The company designs most of its factories, production machines,
and software itself. In a factory, there are several workshops
for the different parts of the manufacturing process. From our
point of view, a workshop is seen as a set of production machines
controlled by a software. That is what we call a \emph{production
system}. Such systems deal with many physical devices, databases,
and also human interactions. Most of these systems run for years,
up to 20 years according to our partner. Maintaining and updating
such legacy software is complicated as documentation is often
outdated, and the developers who wrote these software are not
available anymore.  In this thesis, we propose a solution to the
problem of testing such systems called \textit{Autofunk}, a
framework (and a tool) combining different techniques to: (i)
infer formal models from large (legacy) production systems, and
(ii) perform passive testing in order to detect potential
regressions.

The next section discusses in detail the problems this thesis
addresses. Section \ref{sec:intro:contrib} presents the
contributions of this thesis. Finally, Section
\ref{sec:intro:overview} gives the overview of this thesis.

\section{Problems and objectives}
\label{sec:intro:problems}

Michelin is a tire manufacturer since 1889. With a strong but old
culture of secret, the company uses to design most of its
factories, production machines, and software itself. The
engineering department is dedicated to the construction of these
items, and gathers embedded software engineers, control
engineers, mechanical engineers, and also software engineers. The
computing sub-department deals with software that have been built
for decades, and we can count about 50 different applications,
and even more when we consider the different versions with
customization made for the different factories. For the record,
Michelin owns factories in more than 70 countries.

Different programming languages have been used for building such
software, as well as different development frameworks, and
various paradigms. This context leads to a large and disparate
set of legacy applications that have to be maintained, but also
updated with new features. As most of these software are built
for controlling and supervising a set of production machines in a
factory, they are considered critical in the sense that they can
break the production flow. The main issue faced by the software
engineers is the introduction of regressions. A regression is a
software fault that makes a feature stop functioning as intended
after a certain event, for instance, the deployment of a new
version of a software. Regressions have to be revealed as soon as
possible in order to avoid production downtimes.

The goal of this thesis is to propose technical solutions to
Michelin's engineers to prevent such regressions with testing.
We determine, by means of passive testing, whether a change in
one part of a software affects other parts of it. The main
assumption in this work is that we choose to consider a running
production system in a production environment (that is, a
factory) as a fully operational system, \emph{i.e.} a system that
behaves correctly.  Such a hypothesis has been expressed by our
partner. The inferred models can be employed for different
purposes, \emph{e.g.}, testing, but it is manifest that they
should not be used for conformance testing in general. Last but
not least, we propose scalable techniques because production
systems exchange thousands of \emph{production events} a day.

In this thesis, we provide solutions for making Michelin's
production systems more reliable by means of testing, to ease
software engineers' work, thanks to two main lines:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The inference of partial yet exact models of production
        systems in a fast and efficient manner, based on the data
        exchanged in a (production) environment. A method to
        extract knowledge from data available in a production
        environment has to be defined before inferring models;

    \item The generation of the test cases based on these models
        in order to perform conformance testing of production
        systems. It is worth mentioning that it is possible to
        perform conformance testing here thanks to the assumption
        introduced previously. Finally, due to the nature of
        these systems, the testing method should scale.
\end{itemize}

\section{Contributions of the thesis}
\label{sec:intro:contrib}

The contributions of this thesis are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Autofunk}, a framework, combining several
        techniques originating from different fields such as
        expert systems, machine learning and model inference, for
        inferring formal models of legacy software systems. Our
        main goal is to infer models of Michelin's production
        systems with a \emph{black-box} approach. We choose to
        leverage the data exchanged among the devices and
        software in order to target most of the existing Michelin
        applications without having to consider the programming
        languages or frameworks used to develop any of these
        applications. \textit{Autofunk}'s modular architecture
        allows multiple extensions so that we can take different
        data sources as input, and perform various tasks based on
        the inferred models, \emph{e.g.}, testing;

    \item An empirical study that evaluates \textit{Autofunk} on
        web applications for inferring models. Here,
        \textit{Autofunk} is combined with an automatic testing
        technique to interact with web applications in order to
        improve the completeness of the inferred models. Several
        models can be built at different levels of abstraction,
        allowing to create, for instance, human-readable
        documentation. This preliminary work targeting web
        applications validates our ideas and concepts to infer
        models from data recorded in a (production) environment;

    \item An empirical study that evaluates \textit{Autofunk} on
        Michelin's production systems, proving that it is able to
        build exact models in an efficient manner, based on large
        sets of traces. For now, we define a set of traces as
        information collected from a production system, and
        describing its behaviors. A more formal definition is
        given in the sequel of this thesis. Exactness of our
        inferred models is defined by the trace-equivalence and
        trace-inclusion relations proposed in \cite{petrenko06}.
        This study shows that our model inference technique
        scales well;

    \item A reduction technique for symbolic transition systems
        that is both fast and efficient, keeping the exactness of
        the models, and targeting large models. This technique
        has successfully been applied to large Michelin
        production systems. This is a context-specific reduction
        technique that improves the usability of the inferred
        models, favouring the adoption of \emph{Autofunk} at
        Michelin;

    \item An offline passive testing technique leveraging the
        inferred models for testing production systems, along
        with a case study. This work is an extension of
        \textit{Autofunk} introducing two implementation
        relations: (i) the first relation refers to the trace
        preorder relation \cite{DNH84}, and (ii) the second
        relation is used to overcome a limitation caused by the
        partialness of the inferred models. This testing
        extension detects differences between two production
        systems, \emph{i.e.} potential regressions;

    \item An online passive testing technique similar to the
        offline passive testing, but enabling on-the-fly testing
        of production systems. Even if the offline passive
        testing technique introduced in the previous point is
        able to quickly find regressions between two systems,
        this online passive testing approach allows to detect
        potential regressions faster.

\section{Overview of the thesis}
\label{sec:intro:overview}

The work presented in this thesis deals with two main research
realms: (i) (software) model inference, and (ii) software
testing. Hence, Chapter \ref{sec:related} is split into two main
sections. Chapters \ref{sec:modelinf:webapps} and
\ref{sec:modelinf:prodsystems} are dedicated to the model
inference of software systems (web applications first, and
production systems then). Chapter \ref{sec:testing} is dedicated
to the testing of production systems.

\textbf{Chapter \ref{sec:related}} surveys the literature in
software testing first, and then in model inference applied to
software systems. The chapter starts by introducing what software
testing means, mentioning some important notions as well as the
different types of testing. It then presents what Model-based
Testing (MbT) is, along with a few definitions and common terms
employed in MbT. The software testing part ends with a review on
some passive testing techniques, and why they are interesting in
our case. The second part of this chapter presents what model
inference is, from active learning to passive learning
techniques.

\textbf{Chapter \ref{sec:modelinf:webapps}} presents our work on
model inference applied to web applications, a preliminary work
that gave birth to \textit{Autofunk}, our modular framework for
inferring models (and later, performing testing). This chapter
gives an overview of \textit{Autofunk}'s very first architecture,
called \emph{Autofunk v1}.  It then presents how
\textit{Autofunk} relies on an automatic testing technique to
improve the completeness of the inferred models. A note on its
implementation is then given, following by an experimentation.
This work has been published in \emph{Actes de la 13eme
{\'e}dition d’AFADL, atelier francophone sur les Approches
Formelles dans l’Assistance au D{\'e}veloppement de Logiciels}
(AFADL'14) \cite{durand2014inference}, and in the Proceedings of
the Fifth Symposium on Information and Communication Technology
(SoICT'14)
\cite{DBLP:conf/soict/DurandS14}.

\textbf{Chapter \ref{sec:modelinf:prodsystems}} introduces our
framework \textit{Autofunk} revisited to target production
systems. This chapter gives the context that led to our choices
regarding the design of \textit{Autofunk v2}. Our reduction
technique that heavily reduces models is then presented, along
with the results of a case study on Michelin's production
systems. A whole section is dedicated to the implementation of
\textit{Autofunk} for Michelin. Last significant part of this
chapter is the use of a machine learning technique to maximize
one part of our model inference technique, which led to the
creation of \emph{Autofunk v3}. This work has been published in
the Proceedings of Formal Methods 2015 (FM'15)
\cite{DBLP:conf/fm/DurandS15}, and in the Proceedings of the 9th
International Conference on Distributed Event-Based Systems
(DEBS'15) \cite{DBLP:conf/debs/SalvaD15}.

\textbf{Chapter \ref{sec:testing}} tackles the problem of testing
production systems, without disturbing them, and without having
any specification. It presents our work on both offline and
online passive testing, by extending \textit{Autofunk v3}'s model
inference framework. After having presented the overall idea, two
algorithms are given and explained. The results of a case study
on Michelin's production systems is given. Such results are
related to the offline passive testing technique. Part of this
work has been published in the Proceedings of the 13th
International Conference on Formal Methods and Models for
Co-Design (MEMOCODE'15) \cite{7340480}.

\textbf{Chapter \ref{sec:conclusion}} closes the main body of the
thesis with concluding comments and proposals for future work.
