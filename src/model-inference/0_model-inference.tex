\chapter{Model inference}
\label{sec:modelinf}

Models are essential while working on the design of complex systems to build
reliable implementations. But, they are also particularly useful when systems
reach maintenance cycle, easing comprehension of the overall design and
describing how these systems work under the hood. This is important because
people who are responsible for maintaining or improving systems are most likely
not the same who designed and built them. It is nearly impossible for one
person to know all the details related to a particular system, hence the need
for creating and maintaining models.
