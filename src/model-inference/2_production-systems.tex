\section{Production systems}
\label{sec:modelinf:prodsystems}

In the industry, building models for production systems, i.e.
event-driven systems that run in production environments and are
distributed over several devices and sensors, is frequent since
these are valuable in many situations like testing and fault
diagnosis for instance. Models may have been written as
storyboards or with languages such as the Unified Modelling
Language (UML) or even more formal languages. Usually, these
models are designed when brand-new systems are built. It has been
pointed out by our industrial partner that production systems
have a life span of many years, up to 20 years, and are often
incrementally updated, but not their corresponding models. This
leads to a major issue which is to keep these models up to date
and synchronised with the respective systems. This is a common
problem with documentation in general, and it often implies
rather under-specified or not documented systems that no one
wants to maintain because of lack of understanding.
