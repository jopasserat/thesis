\section{Model inference}
\label{sec:conclusion:modelinf}

Our main contribution to model inference is a combination of
different techniques coming from heterogenous fields in a
framework named \textit{Autofunk}. This framework leverages different
techniques such as machine learning, data mining, and expert
systems. Experiment results prove both speed and effectiveness of
this solution, however there is always room for improvement.
