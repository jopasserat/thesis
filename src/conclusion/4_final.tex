\section{Final thoughts}
\label{sec:conclusion:final-thoughts}

In this thesis, we proposed a solution to a practical problem
that led to two main research directions, each opening the door
to many different fields as well as many new challenges. The
collaboration with Michelin has been successful, yet we believe
that working with other industrial companies would be a huge
benefit, and moving toward a consortium would be interesting for
both Academia and Industry people.

Over the last three years, we met several researchers who were
working on legacy systems. Such systems may be outdated or old,
given how software are deeply established in our lives, computer
scientists are just at the beginning of the research realm on
these systems.
