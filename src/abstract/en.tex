This thesis is concerned with the problem of preventing
regressions in (legacy) production systems by means of
Model-based Testing. A production system is defined as a set of
production machines controlled by a software, in a factory.
Despite the large body of work within the field of Model-based
Testing, a common issue remains the writing of models describing
either the system under test or its specification. It is a
tedious task that is even more complicated when the systems are
referenced as "legacy", \emph{i.e.} out of date, and often not
(or poorly) documented. A second point to take into account is
that poduction systems often run continuously and should not be
disrupted, which makes most of the existing classical testing
techniques unsuable.

We present an approach to infer models from traces, \emph{i.e.}
sequences of events observed in a production environment, to
address the first issue.
