\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:testing:conclusion}

In this section, we present a fast offline passive testing
framework combining different fields such as model inference,
expert systems, and machine learning. Such a framework is an
extension of previous works based on model inference, whose name
is Autofunk.

Given a large set of production events, our framework infers
exact models whose traces are included in the initial trace set
of a system under analysis.  Such models are then reused as
specifications to perform offline passive testing, using a second
set of traces recorded on a system under test.  Using two
implementation relations, Autofunk is able to determine what has
changed between the two systems. This is particularly useful for
our industrial partner Michelin since potential regressions can
be detected while deploying changes in production. Initial
results are encouraging, and Michelin engineers see a real
potential in this framework.
