\chapter{Testing applied to production systems}
\label{sec:testing}


In this chapter, we tackle the problem of testing industrial
systems (as defined in the previous chapter), without disturbing
them, and without having any specification. Those two constraints
sounds familiar as they have already been taken into
consideration in the previous chapter.

In the first section, we describe our work on a passive testing
technique that has been built on top of Autofunk's Models
generator. Section \ref{sec:testing:onpassive} presents an online
version of such a technique. We introduce an active testing
method in Section \ref{sec:testing:active}, and we conclude in
Section \ref{sec:testing:conclusion}.
