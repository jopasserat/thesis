\chapter{Testing applied to production systems}
\label{sec:testing}

In this chapter, we tackle the problem of testing production
systems (as defined in the previous chapter), without disturbing
them, and without having any specification \emph{a priori}. Those
two constraints sounds familiar as they have already been taken
into consideration in the previous chapter. We present a passive
testing technique built on-top of \emph{Autofunk v3}. First, we
infer reference models of a system under analysis $\mathit{Sua}$.
Then, we check whether a system under test ($\mathit{Sut}$)
conforms to these inferred models by means of two implementation
relations. We reuse the trace preorder relation, and we propose
our own implementation relation to comply with Michelin's needs.
